    <h2 id="about-me">about me</h2>
    <p>troy kaighin astarte is (for now) a lecturer in computer science
    at <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/t.k.astarte/">swansea
    university</a>. troy graduated with a degree in computer science and
    a phd in the history of computer science from newcastle university.
    their research is in the history of computing and computer science,
    with previous work on the history of programming language semantics
    and concurrency. troy’s teaching is in various areas of computing
    with a focus on shaping a more socially-aware generation of
    graduates.</p>
    <p>at swansea, they are a member of the educational, historical, and
    philosophical foundations of computer science research group (<a
    href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/research-and-impact/educational-historical-philosophical-foundations/"
    title="ehp research group page">ehp</a>), the robert recorde centre
    for fundamental studies, the centre for digital arts and humanities
    (<a href="https://codah.swansea.ac.uk/"
    title="codah web pages">codah</a>), the <a
    href="https://swansea-theory.github.io/"

    and the <a href="http://hocc.swansea.ac.uk"
    title="history of computing collection pages">history of computing
    collection</a>.</p>
    <p>outside swansea, troy is the editor-in-chief of <a
    href="http://computer.org/annals" title="annals">ieee annals of the
    history of computing</a>, a member of the <a
    href="https://www.computer.org/volunteering/boards-and-committees/history"
    title="ieee cs history">ieee cs history committee</a>, and <a
    href="http://history.acm.org" title="acm history committee">acm
    history committee</a>.</p>
    <p>as an agender person (pronouns: <a
    href="https://pronouns.alysbrooks.com/they/.../themself"
    title="pronoun use guide">they/them</a>) troy appreciates
    gender-neutral terms of address. this is why the bio is written in
    the third person. they like to be called ‘troy’ or if more formality
    is needed, ‘dr. troy’. please, not ‘professor’ or ‘sir’.</p>

    <p>if you want bibtex of any publication, they are all here: <a
    href="res/tkastarte.bib"
    title="download bibtex of my publications">tkastarte.bib</a>.</p>
    <p>i decided most people probably don’t care that much about every
    talk, proceedings edited, reviews, and the like. you can find most
    of them in the above-linked bib if you really want. i haven’t
    included the journal editorials.</p>
    <p>i might host pdfs here later. for now, if you see this page and
    really want a pdf, <a href="#dr-troy-kaighin-astarte"
