                        In January 2019, I will be returning to Amsterdam again to teach on the &lsquo;History of Digital Cultures&rsquo; course at Universiteit van Amsterdam.

                        This is an international interdisciplinary group effort and we last met in October 2018 in Bertinoro, Italy, for a few days of stimulating intellectual discussion.
                        During that time we launched the project wiki&mdash;not yet open to the general public&mdash;which we hope will be an interesting vehicle for collaborative work.

                        I took a break from thesis writing to attend the <a href="http://eshs2018.uk" title="Link to pages of ESHS conference">European Society for the History of Science Biennial Conference 2018</a>.
                        There, I gave a talk entitled &lsquo;Origins and Impact of Formal Semantics&rsquo;,
                        a rather grand title for what was mostly a talk about John McCarthy's work in formal semantics.

                                    The emergence of high-level programming languages that began in the late 1950s brought great advantages to the programming community in terms of programmer productivity, ease of design, and the ability to use programs on different machines. However, the additional abstraction created new problems: how can a programmer be certain of the meaning of constructs in a programming language? How can a designer reason about the correctness of a program? How can one have trust that a compiler correctly reflects the semantics of a programming language?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Beginning in the 1960s, a school of study developed to address these concerns: the formal specification of programming languages. The most interesting aspect of this work concerns the semantics, or meaning, of the languages concerned. At first, the proponents of formal semantics were full of enthusiasm and ambition about their techniques. Yet, over time, the expected penetration of this work was not achieved despite continued theoretical study.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This talk will situate the field of formal semantics within the history of computing. It will explore the various motivations and expectations of the historical actors involved in formal semantics. It will then consider how well the various different proposed solutions to the semantic problem achieved these goals, before examining the other ways in which work on formal semantics impacted computing generally.

                        The majority of 2018 was spent writing my thesis &lsquo;Formalising Meaning: a History of Programming Language Semantics&rsquo;.
                        It is lengthy and goes rather in-depth in places, but I am quite pleased with it.

                                    The emergence of high-level programming languages in the 1950s brought a series of challenges to the burgeoning computing community. Many of these centred around the difficulty of determining precisely the meaning of programming languages. This was a key issue for both those writing translators for languages and those writing programs in these languages. People in the computing and mathematics worlds attempted to address these challenges by creating a variety of ways to describe the semantics of high-level languages (the issue of defining syntax was more quickly resolved).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The history of the development of formal semantic description techniques is ex- plored, with a particular focus on two centres of research: the IBM Laboratory in Vienna, and the Programming Research Group in Oxford. The stories of these two threads of development create interesting contrasts and similarities and discussing them&mdash;as well as the previous works that motivated them and the subsequent work inspired by them&mdash;can tell us much about programming languages and formal computing today, as well as the culture and context of computing in the 1960s and 1970s.

                                    This work takes both a historical and technical approach. Looking at historical developments, considering the people involved in research, their motivations, the situations in which they worked, and how they interacted informs understanding of their technical outputs. Exploring the technical side, however, also helps uncover additional historical angles, such as interactions and influences both positive and negative.

                        I spent the month of January 2018 in Amsterdam,
                        teaching on the History of Digital Cultures module offered by the Universiteit van Amsterdam
                        (an old version of the course description can be found on the <a href="http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/uva/sgs/en/c/14066.html" title="History of Digital Cultures course description.">UvA website</a>).
                        This wonderful opportunity was offered to me by <a href="http://www.uva.nl/profiel/a/l/g.alberts/g.alberts.html" title="UvA staff profile page of Gerard Alberts.">
                            Gerard Alberts</a>,
                        a very fine historian.
                        I had a great time supervising students through their month-long research projects,
                        and was very impressed with the quality of work produced.
                        I also feel I learnt a lot about the process of history, and believe I will write a better thesis as a result.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        In October 2017, I went to the
                        <a title="HaPoC 4 conference link" href="http://www.hapoc2017.sciencesconf.org">Fourth International Conference on the History and Philosophy of Computing</a>
                        in Brno,
                        an excellent conference full of interesting talks and even more interesting people.
                        There, I presented a talk entitled &lsquo;Towards an Interconnected History of Semantics&rsquo;,
                        which&mdash;as implied by the word 'towards'&mdash;was something of a work-in-progress.
                        The aim was to address the confluence and influence in the history of semantics rather than making comparisons,
                        and the talk was essentially a series of anecdotes about various events.
                        A short abstract and slides for the talk can be found by clicking the buttons below.
                        Additionally, an 'extended abstract' three pages in length is also available.
                        I also gave a version of the talk at the <a href="https://www.bshm.ac.uk/events/research-progress-1" title="BSHM RIP conference link">BSHM Research in Progress</a> symposium again in February 2018.

                                        Formal semantics is often discussed in terms of disparate approaches: operational, denotational, axiomatic, and by equivalence. Divisions are also made in terms of locations: the IBM group in Vienna and the Programming Research Group in Oxford are examples.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        These are often useful distinctions to make when discussing the technicalities of semantics. To present a historical account in this siloed way, however, could be problematic. In fact there were a number of important points of interaction between the people and groups of people involved on working with formal semantics. Furthermore, these and other interactions led to the sharing and adoption of ideas between groups.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Some important interactions include the Formal Language Description Languages conference in Baden-bei-Wien in 1964; Mervyn Pragnell's unofficial reading groups in London in the early 1960s; and the IFIP Working Group 2.2 meeting in Vienna in 1969.

                                        We are working on the history of formal descriptions of the semantics of programming languages. Semantic descriptions are structured, mathematical models or rule sets which enable reasoning about the effects of programs written in the language. Semantic descriptions offer this ability to reason by (i) providing abstract interpreters that, given a program and a starting state, either compute the final state or characterise the set of permissible final states; (ii) mapping the given language into tractable mathematical functions (in simple cases, functions from states to states); or (iii) providing rules of inference for reasoning about assertions that describe the effect of programs. These broad categorisations are usually referred to as (i) operational; (ii) denotational; and (iii) axiomatic.

                                    <p>
                                        One of the most frequently defined languages is ALGOL 60, which has been influential in the history of programming languages in many ways. It is a simple but powerful language, with elegant and clean concepts at the heart of its design; many important techniques in compiler design were developed as a result of ALGOL 60, such as Dijkstras display mechanism. The syntax definition method known as Backus&ndash;Naur Form (BNF), still the academic standard, was developed for ALGOL 60, and the concise natural language semantics and context conditions described the language carefully (if informally and incompletely) in the ALGOL Report.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        There exist at least four reasonably complete formal semantic descriptions of ALGOL 60 in fundamentally different styles (two are operational and two denotational) and these are used as a vehicle for the comparison of the underlying approaches used in language descriptions in the period 1960&ndash;1980.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Starting with a key reference of McCarthy's paper at the 1964 Formal Language Description Languages IFIP Working Conference (which only addresses a subset of ALGOL 60 but illustrates many important ideas), we review semantic descriptions in VDL, Functional, Oxford Denotational, and VDM Denotational semantics. We attempt to present only the key aspects of the definitions, sifting away the many stylistic issues which do not relate to the underlying semantic approaches: for example, we look at handling of jumps, name spaces, and type procedure evaluation. We will also sketch the contexts in which these definitions were written.

                        &lsquo;Challenges for semantic description:
                        comparing responses from the main approaches&rsquo;
                        is a paper authored by Cliff Jones and me.
                        It is a technical explanation of some of the aspects of programming languages that make writing semantics tricky,
                        and a comparison of some of the solutions proposed.
                        It includes the semantics of an example core language,
                        and a more realistic concurrent object-oriented language.

                                        Although there are thousands of programming languages, most of them share common features. This paper reviews some key underlying language concepts and the challenges they present to the task of formally describing language semantics. The responses to these challenges in operational, axiomatic and denotational approaches to semantic description are reviewed. There are interesting overlaps between these responses; similarities are exposed even where accidental notational conventions disguise them so that essential differences can be pinpointed. Depending on the objectives of writing a formal semantic description of a language, one or other approach might be considered the best choice. An argument is made for increasing the use of formal semantics in language design and here it is suggested that the operational approach is the most viable for a complete language description.

                        &lsquo;Formalism in the Forest: the 1964 <emph>Formal Language Description Languages</emph> IFIP Working Conference&rsquo; is a draft paper I have written connected with the talk given at the BSHM mentioned above.
                        The paper, for which a first draft has been written but to which extensions and corrections are yet to be made, is currently on an indefinite hiatus,
                        and may simply end up as content in my thesis.
                        The abstract can be read below, but note that it is the same as given for the BSHM event.

                                        The emergence of high-level programming languages in the 1950s brought a series of challenges to the burgeoning computing community. Many of these centred around the difficulty of determining precisely the meaning of programming languages, and programs written in these languages. A number of different people in the computing and mathematics worlds attempted to address these challenges by creating a variety of ways to describe the syntax, grammars, and especially semantics of high-level languages. Interest in this topic came together at a conference on the subject held in Baden-bei-Wien in September 1964, an extremely important event in the history of theoretical and formal computer science. The story of this conference and some of its participants will be explored.

                        &lsquo;Formal semantics of ALGOL 60: a comparison of four descriptions&rsquo; is also the title of a paper written by Cliff Jones and myself.
                        The technical report version of the paper is published (with a slightly different title), as linked below.
                        There is also a version submitted to the proceedings of HaPoP-2016, which will be published in due course.

                                        The programming language ALGOL 60 has been used to illustrate several different styles of formal semantic description. This paper identifies the main challenges in providing a formal semantics for imperative programming languages and reviews the responses to these challenges in four relatively complete formal descriptions of ALGOL 60. The aim is to identify the key concepts rather than get bogged down in the minutiae of notational conventions adopted by their authors. As well as providing historical pointers and comparisons, the paper attempts to draw some general conclusions about semantic description styles.

                    <p>
                        I am interested in the history of computing,
                        in particular the history of theoretical computer science.
                        I also take an interest in the formal and theoretical aspects of computer science.
                        This includes semantics of programming languages,
                        modelling of systems (including and especially concurrent systems),
                        and verification of programs and systems.

                    <p>
                        Beyond computing, I enjoy
                        <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/litfried/">drum &amp; bass music</a>,
                        tabletop games,

                        With the help of a summer student, Callan Heard,
                        I adapted the timeline from <a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/" title="Simile Widgets">
                            Simile Widgets
                        </a>
                        to include some important events in the history of programming language semantics.
